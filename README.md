Data Processing and Visualization App
This is a Python-based application designed for data processing, visualization, and machine learning predictions. It provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter for loading, processing, and analyzing datasets. The application also supports training and testing machine learning models, as well as making predictions based on user input.

Features
Data Loading: Load datasets in CSV or Excel formats.

Data Processing:

Handle missing values by dropping rows with null values.

Encode categorical and target columns using Label Encoding.

Balance datasets using Random Over-Sampling.

Perform feature selection to identify the most relevant features.

Data Visualization:

Plot histograms, scatter plots, and 3D scatter plots for up to 3 features.

Machine Learning:

Train and test machine learning models (Random Forest or Deep Learning).

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Prediction:

Make predictions based on user input using the trained model.

Clear input fields and reset predictions for new inputs.
